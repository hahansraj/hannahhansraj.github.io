            <p> Hi! My name is Hannah. I was born in Chicago, IL on October 11th, 2001. I'm in 10th grade at Whitney Young. I live in West Loop with my mom, dad, and sister, Alyssa. My name means "favor" or "grace".

            <ul>
                <li>From Kindergarden to 6th grade, I went to Hawthorne Scholastic Academy. In 7th grade, I transfered to Whitney Young, and have been here ever since.
                <li>At Hawthorne, I was in the Battle of the Books club. At Whitney, Iâ€™m in several clubs, including International Culture Explorers, Kiva, Science Olympiad, and Math Team. 
                <li>Outside of school, I do Math Circles, play piano, and several things within my religious community. I also used to ice skate, but stopped in 8th grade.  
                <li>My favorite subject at school is ECS!
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>To be honest, I don't know what I want to do, or where I want to go to college. I just know that I want to do something that helps others.
                <li>I would love to visit a developing country and work there for a while, maybe teach at an elementary school there briefly. 
                <li>I love to travel. In the past, I have been to London and Paris. In the furture, I want to travel to many different places. Namely Italy, Switzerland, and Turkey.

            <ol>
                <li>I hope to be at least able to run for a bit without getting out of breath. 
                <li>I am a pretty mentally unstable person. A lot of times, I freak out over things that most people wouldn't even bat an eye at. My goal for the future is to try not do that as much. 
                <li>I hope to not let my anxious nature get in the way of normal social interactions.
